# Weather App
This weather web app built with Flask and OpenWeather API displays the weather forecast for any city. I designed a simplistic UI to make it easier for the user to find the relevant information. All HTML, CSS, and Python code was written from scratch and the CSS is optimised for mobile and desktop through the use of CSS grid, flexbox, and media queries.
